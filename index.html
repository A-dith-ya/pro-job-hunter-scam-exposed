            Online you'll mostly see positive testimonials about this company
            because <strong>negative reviews get removed or hidden</strong>.
            They'll say anything to get you to sign up. You're better off
            applying to jobs yourself and saving your money, instead of paying

                I signed up with Pro Job Hunter after their HR told me on a call
                that I'd get
                <strong
                  >at least one guaranteed face-to-face interview within 5
                  weeks</strong

                service was expensive.
